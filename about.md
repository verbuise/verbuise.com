## Why we exist

Most products ship in one market and never leave it. Not because the builder doesn't want global users — but because going global has always meant building a second product. Different codebases, separate content pipelines, localization dashboards, and months of overhead before a single user in another country feels at home.

Verbuise exists to eliminate that friction. We're building the globalization runtime — the adaptive layer that makes your product feel native everywhere, automatically, without rebuilding anything.

## How it started

Verbuise was built by a solo developer, still in high school at the time. The observation was simple: too many people couldn't use products they would have loved because those products only spoke one language, showed one currency, and assumed one culture.

Building Verbuise meant balancing real constraints — a full schedule including over 600 hours a year of community volunteering, college classes, and part-time work. None of that made the project smaller. It just made every decision count.

The moment when friends from different countries tested the first version and it worked — when their language came back correctly, when the currency matched where they were — that was the moment Verbuise became something real.

## What we're building

Verbuise is a globalization runtime, not a translation tool. The difference matters.

Translation tools give you a dashboard to manage strings. Verbuise gives you a runtime that adapts your product automatically — language, currency, images, tone, and offers — based on who's using it and where they are.

We use Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini in tandem, cycling translations through multiple models to verify accuracy before anything reaches a user. The result is adaptation that feels native, not mechanical.

## Who this is for

We build Verbuise for the same people who built their products the way we built ours: indie SaaS founders, mobile developers, AI product builders, and fast-moving startup teams who want global reach without global complexity.

Not localization managers. Builders.

## The vision

A future where language and cultural differences are never the reason a product doesn't reach the people it was built for.

That's the goal. Everything else is a step toward it.

            <span class="section-label">Our Story</span>
            <h2 class="section-title">Built by Someone Who Gets It</h2>
        </div>
        <div style="max-width: 720px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--gray-600); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                Verbuise was born out of a personal frustration. Growing up with friends from different nationalities, I watched them struggle with English while trying to navigate websites, apps, and services that weren't built for them.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--gray-600); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The existing localization tools were either too expensive, too complicated, or simply not good enough. Small businesses and startups were left behind, unable to reach the 75% of internet users who don't speak English as their first language.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--gray-600); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                Building Verbuise as a solo developer while still in high school was challenging. Balancing 600 hours of volunteering, college classes, and part-time work pushed me to my limits. But seeing those first translations work perfectly—verified by friends who speak those languages natively—made it all worth it.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--gray-600);">
                Today, Verbuise is trusted by over 500 companies worldwide. But we're just getting started.
